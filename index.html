    <p id = "s">Spacey: <i>holding his prosthetic revolver on his left hand.</i> What the
     hell are you doing in my house!</p>
    <br>
    <p id = "q">Quincy: sorry.I just fell in accidentally. I’ll get out of your way yeah?</p>
    <br>
    <p id = "s">Spacey: Yeah I don’t think i’ll take that from a
     stranger that’s in my house. Get out or I’ll shoot. </p>
    <br>
    <p id = "q">Quincy: Ok ok ok ok ok ok. </p>
    <br>
    <i><p id = "ness">Quincy then crawls up to the tv while Spacey watches him phase through the tv screen with his whole body. White noise start to get louder when his whole body goes deeper in, leaving his legs out. </p>
    </i>
        <br>
    <p id = "s">Spacey: WOAH WOAH WOAH HEY NOW Spacey rush to the tv 
    to grab Quincy’s legs to pull him out of the tv. </p>
    <br>
    <p id = "q">Quincy: I thought you want me out. Now you want me in? </p>
    <br>
    <p id = "s">Spacey: What were you doing. How did you do that? The - Is now 
    reaching his hand out to the tv. Touching the screen. Why can’t I?</p>
    <br>

    <img id = "img" src = "spacey 2.png"200px" >
    <br>
    <p id = "s">Spacey: What does that mean?</p>
    <br>
    <p id = "q">Quincy: You’re one of the many of the lucky ones who can live in this world. 
    You have a place here. </p>
    <br>
    <p id = "s">Spacey: What the hell are you saying?</p>
    <br>
    <p id = "q">Quincy: You actually belong in this world. You can go to school, concerts, make love, 
    murder, and slaughter. But You are made to do those things. You are made to go to school, concerts, make 
    love, murder, and slaughter. And my existence in your life is a malfunction. I don’t belong here. I don’t 
    belong anywhere.</p>
    <br>
    <p id = "s">Spacey: You’re insane.</p>
    <br>
    <p id = "q">Quincy: Am I? But at least I my own choice to be that way. No one can control me. 
    I am out of the system way before. But I have to stand and watch people from multiple scenarios, 
    hiding behind screens in fear I’ll get erased by your fucking creator. My home is nothing but 
    static and screens to different places that I can’t go to without some bitch watching all over 
    the worlds. </p>
    <br>
    <i> <p id = "ness">A long silence surrounds them. Spacey confused. </p></i>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p id = "q">Quincy: I may have said that…</p>
    <br>
    <p id = "s">Spacey: How do you gain that ability?</p>
    <br>
    <p id = "q">Quincy: because of what I am. </p>
    <br>
    <p id = "s">Spacey: Can I…Get in there??</p>
    <br>

    <p id = "s">Spacey: I know, I know. But I feel like I don’t belong here. I don’t know how. But I just know in my gut i don’t belong in this world.
